## Features

- Interactive grid for placing **start**, **end**, and **barrier** nodes
- Real-time visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm
- Color-coded grid to represent node states (open, closed, path, etc.)
- Fully resettable and customizable with keyboard/mouse controls

## Example Usage

```python
# Example:
# Step 1: Run the script
# Step 2: Click once to set the start node (cyan)
# Step 3: Click again to set the end node (magenta)
# Step 4: Click around to place barriers (black)
# Step 5: Press SPACE to start A* pathfinding
# Step 6: Watch the algorithm explore and draw the path (blue)
```
